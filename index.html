  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>My name is Anh Minh Ngo. I'm from <em>Danang, Vietnam</em>. I am a first-year Master student, majoring in Information Technology &amp; Management (Software Development) at IIT.</p>
  <p>I love spending my time just sitting infront of my PC's monitor playing games or coding.</p>
  <p>I also love playing sports, espicially with friends. I play every sport but my main sport is swimming.</p>
  <p>I had been a professional competitive swimmer for my city in some national swimming competitions for 12 years since I was in grade 1.</p>
  <p>I stopped competing once I came to the US for university in 2017. That was sad to say goodbye but luckily I became a professional Lifeguard for UIC's swimming pool, I was able to see the pool again and to keep safety of patrons.</p>
  <p>This was one of the most amazing experience I have ever had while at the US.</p>
